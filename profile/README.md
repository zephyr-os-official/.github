# [Zephyr Operating System](https://github.com/load-dev/Zephyr)
## Operating system that is simple

> - Hello everyone, i want you to welcome in official github page of Zephyr. In this page you will get information about this operating system (i will be using shortcut for operating system "OS") and will get also information how to use it.
>
> - First of all, our social pages are visible and public. [Our wiki website](https://zephyr.load-dev.xyz) is made with GitBook (free to use app to create wikipedias) but we are good with it for now, and we dont need to change it. Then our [discord server](https://discord.gg/5tEP24E2xx) is something where you can communicate with others.
> - Then before using our OS we recommend to read [terms](https://zephyr.load-dev.xyz/legal/terms) and [privacy policy](https://zephyr.load-dev.xyz/legal/privacy) on our wiki. Thats it for the intro. Everything you will need (tutorials and api reference) you will find out our [wiki page](https://zephyr.load-dev.xyz).
>
> - **To visit the main repository, click [this link](https://github.com/load-dev/Zephyr) because it is on the old profile, and we do not want to transfer everything from there to here. On this Organization, there will be only things from the OS wil be taking data (for example package installing) and these kind of things.**
> - See ya later :wave:
